# amia_flutter_103

This Flutter project was designed for the AMIA 2021 Clinical Informatics Conference, W03: Workshop - Flutter Higher with FHIR: Learn to Create Interoperable Healthcare Apps in Real Time. Information about this workshop can be found [here](https://s4.goeshow.com/amia/cic/2021/schedule_at_a_glance.cfm?session_key=502CC075-007D-EB11-80E9-E2016027A0A5&session_date=Tuesday,%20May%2018,%202021).

## Getting Started

Follow [these steps](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) to get Flutter installed on your machine.

NOTE: If you are using a Mac, feel free to follow the steps from my [Fish and Flutter: 5 Step Install](https://youtu.be/unMS6Tn_oEI) video and its associated [blog post](https://mayjuun.com/blog/7-fish-and-flutter/). There are many advantages to having a high-quality terminal shell to supplement your workflow. The example in this video, entitled '[Why Linux is Better for Programming](https://youtu.be/otDOHt_Jges?t=210)' was part of my incentive to create a video showing my workflow that harnesses terminal shells (iTerm/Fish) with package managers (Homebrew/Fisher) to drastically speed up your workflow.

## About FHIR-FLI

We have a number of [instructional blog posts](https://mayjuun.com/fhirfli/) designed to help you get up and running with [FHIR](https://hl7.org/fhir/overview.html) data in your Flutter application. We also have a ['FHIR-FLI' Slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/fhir-fli/shared_invite/zt-ofv2cycm-9yjdMj8a~zXp7nDBeB_sNQ) for others similarly interested in the connection between Flutter apps and FHIR data. Feel free to join!
